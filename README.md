# iv-calculator
Automates calculating Pokemon IVs across a range of levels. This script helps keep track of the cumulative IV spread after each level-up and eliminates impossible IV values. Calculations are from https://legendarypkmn.github.io/javacalc.html

Currently targetted at Gen III so any in-game IV appraisals from later gens aren't considered.
